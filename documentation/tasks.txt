Server/Client socket infrastructure – Listening on a port, accepting requests from the client, connecting to a socket - Terry

Command line parser for client and server – This will need to be updated as commands are added.
 
CLI infrastructure – This will also need to be updated as commands are added   
 
Public key exchange – I think it would easiest if one person did both the client and the server side as they need to be debugged together - Terry
 
Generation of the session key and the exchange of the session key
 
Generation of users’ public/private keys
 
User authorization – Server commands to authorize a particular user (includes the key ring), client authorization on the server, client requests to be authorized – Again this might be easier if one person did both sides
 
Encryption and decryption
 
Server transaction logging and commands in the CLI to view it
 
Client hashing of a file to be uploaded with the user’s identity
 
Client/Server requests to upload and download files
 
Server verification of the uploaded file hash
 
Management of list of authorized users for an uploaded file
 
CA function or separate process (I recommend that we at least start with a function and then if we get ambitious we can opt to build a CA server). We can have it read from a file a list of user identities and their public keys.
